What is AutoSphinx ?
--------------------

AutoSphinx is free and open source (*) |Sphinx|_ add-ons which provide two tools for |Python|_
projects.  The first one generates automatically the RST files for an API documentation based on the
*autogen* extension.  The second one provides a document generator based on the concept of literate
programming which can be used to make an example's based documentation.

How is AutoSphinx licensed ?
----------------------------

AutoSphinx is licensed under the `GPLv3 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.en.html>`_.

Going further with AutoSphinx
-----------------------------

The best way to know what you can do with AutoSphinx, and to learn it, is to look at the examples:

 * :ref:`Examples <examples-page>`
 * :ref:`AutoSphinx Reference Manual <reference-manual-page>`

.. * :ref:`Bibliography <bibliography-page>`

What are the features of the documentation generator ?
------------------------------------------------------

The documentation generator features:

 * intermixing of code, text, `LaTeX formulae <https://www.mathjax.org>`_, figures and plots
 * use the `reStructuredText <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText>`_ syntax for text
 * use the |Sphinx|_ generator
 * embed computations in the text content
 * generation of circuit schematics using |Circuit_macros|_
 * generation of figures using |Tikz|_
 * generation of plots using |Matplotlib|_

Somehow, it is similar to an `Jupyter notebook <https://ipython.org/notebook.html>`_, but it works
differently and provides specific features.

Which platforms are supported by AutoSphinx ?
---------------------------------------------

AutoSphinx runs on Linux, Windows 64-bit and Mac OS X.

How to install AutoSphinx ?
---------------------------

The procedure to install AutoSphinx is described in the :ref:`Installation Manual <installation-page>`.

Which version of Python is required ?
